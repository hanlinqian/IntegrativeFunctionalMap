This section is about identifying and quantifing mRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs and small RNAs; calculating protein-coding RNA expression by Ribo-seq; and obtaining protein-protein interactions.
##### pipeline-circrna.md: Pipeline of identifying and quantifing circRNAs by circRNA-seq;
##### pipeline-lncrna.md: Pipeline of identifying and quantifing lncRNAs;
##### pipeline-ppi.md: Pipeline of obtaining protein-protein interactions of maize after RLL-Y2H assays;
##### pipeline-ribo.md: Pipeline of calculating expression of RNAs being translated by Ribo-seq;
##### pipeline-srnacluster.md: Pipeline of identifying and quantifing small RNA clusters by sRNA-seq;
##### pipeline-totalrna.md: Pipeline of calculating expression of total RNAs by mRNA-seq.
##### The code and data involved in these pipeline were stored in Section0/data and Section0/code.
